# Minecraft But Harder

## What does the plugin do?

The game is quite easy now. This plugin makes the game difficult. Two hits from a zombie and you're dead. Invisible spiders and super-fast creepers. It cannot get worse, right? Well, Endermen won't be dropping Ender Pearls. Yeah.

How do you beat the game? You summon the Zombie Boss using `/spawnboss.`
The Zombie boss drops 25 Eyes of Ender, 64 Ender Pearls and a really cool combat set when you beat him. 13 more than you need to complete and empty portal.

But don't worry, there's a good part too. You get a cool reward every 5 xp levels. These include armor, tools and weapons with custom enchantments!<br>
Secondly, when you die, your precious items get stored in a chest at the spot that you died and you're given that spot's coordinates. You don't wanna lose that stuff, right?

Oh and here's another cool feature; when you die, your cords are sent to you and all your precious items are stored in a chest. Isn't that great? But here's the catch. You lose all of your exp. All of it. Start again from level 0.

Moreover, you get the cooked variant of the food that an animal would usually drop.
Cooked Porkchop instead of Porkchop, Steak instead of Beef, Cooked Mutton instead of Raw Mutton etc.

***IMPORTANT:***<br>
- I am not responsible for coming up with the idea for this plugin. It was my friend's idea. He made a similar plugin a long time ago for 1.12 and 1.16.

- If you wish to edit this code, you'll need to change the systemPath to where you save the ArmorEqupEvent-1.7.2.jar file on line 81 of the pom.xml file.
